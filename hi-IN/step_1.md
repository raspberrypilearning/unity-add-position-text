Right-click in the Hierarchy window, or on the GameObject that you want the text to be a child of, and go to **UI** then select **Text - TextMeshPro**.

This creates a Canvas with child TextMeshPro object; you can see the text in the Game view.

**Tip:** You can view the position of the text in the Game view even when you are not in Play mode.

It's a good idea to rename the text so you will be able to identify it later. Right-click on the new Text - TextMeshPro GameObject and select rename.

Change the text displayed by the TextMeshPro in the Inspector:

![TextMeshPro Inspector showing default New Text.](images/tmp-text.png)

Select the TextMeshPro GameObject to adjust its settings in the Inspector:

![TextMeshPro RectTransform settings in the Inspector.](images/reposition-text.png)

This example would position the centre of your text 120 pixels from the left and -50 pixels from the top, and anchor it to the top left.

**Tip:** Anchoring the text will make it appear in the correct position if you resize your Game view.

You can also add and position 'Button - TextMeshPro' objects in the same way. The text displayed on a button is a child object of the Button.
